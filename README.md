## Purchase onesies at the tip of your fingertips in our e-commerce store.

This website was created using Ruby on Rails 5 with Postgresql. This application is being built as a final project to showcase our understanding of the following:

  * HTTP request/response cycle;
  * Client-facing interaction with a front-end application;
  * Utilization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC model</a> in conjunction with Rails;
  * Implementation of RSpec model and feature tests;
  * Designing database schemas to represent relationships between objects;
  * Appropriate use of <a href="http://codesthq.com/blog/2015/hi-im-poro.html">POROs</a>;
  * Basic SQL statements;
  * Effective communication in order to facilitate collaboration;
  * Application of best practices in project management and Git workflow.
